# Rule: Marp Slide Structure Best Practices

## Description
This rule provides guidelines for structuring Marp slides effectively to ensure readability, maintainability, and proper rendering.

## Implementation Details

### Slide Separation
- Use `---` (three hyphens) on a separate line to create slide breaks
- Always include a blank line before and after slide separators for clarity
- Example:
  ```markdown
  # Slide 1 Content

  ---

  # Slide 2 Content
  ```

### Frontmatter
- Begin each Marp presentation with YAML frontmatter
- Include essential Marp directives in the frontmatter
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ---
  marp: true
  theme: default
  paginate: true
  ---
  ```

### Slide Headers
- Each slide should have a clear header (typically using # or ##)
- Keep headers concise (ideally under 50 characters)
- Use consistent header levels throughout the presentation

### Content Organization
- Limit each slide to one main concept
- Use bullet points for lists (avoid deep nesting)
- Include sufficient whitespace between content blocks

## Benefits
- Consistent slide structure across presentations
- Improved readability in both markdown source and rendered slides
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better rendering in Marp preview and export
