  # Output Management in Jupyter Notebooks

  ## Output Cleanliness
  - Clear unnecessary outputs before sharing notebooks
  - Limit the number of rows displayed for large DataFrames (use `head()`, `tail()`, or `display()`)
  - Use `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')` for non-critical warnings
  - Consider using `%%capture` for cells with verbose output
  - Remove debug print statements before finalizing notebooks

  ## Visualization Best Practices
  - Set appropriate figure sizes for visualizations
  - Include titles, axis labels, and legends for all plots
  - Use consistent styling across visualizations
  - Consider colorblind-friendly color palettes
  - Add captions explaining the key insights from each visualization

  ## Interactive Outputs
  - Use widgets (`ipywidgets`) for interactive exploration when appropriate
  - Ensure interactive elements have clear labels and instructions
  - Consider performance implications of complex interactive visualizations
  - Document any browser-specific requirements for interactive elements
  - Test interactive features in different environments

  ## Output Storage
  - Be cautious about storing large outputs in the notebook file
  - Consider saving large figures or data to external files
  - Use `plt.close()` after creating figures to free memory
  - Clear outputs of cells that generate large temporary results
  - Be mindful of notebook file size when including images or interactive outputs
