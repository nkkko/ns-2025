# Rule: Marp Export and Presentation Best Practices

## Description
This rule provides guidelines for exporting Marp presentations to different formats and delivering them effectively.

## Implementation Details

### Export Formats
- Export to PDF for maximum compatibility
- Consider HTML for interactive presentations
- Use PPTX only when edits in PowerPoint are required
- Include export commands in the README or as comments:
  ```bash
  # Export to PDF
  npx @marp-team/marp-cli presentation.md --pdf
  
  # Export to HTML
  npx @marp-team/marp-cli presentation.md --html
  ```

### File Organization
- Store images in a dedicated `images/` subdirectory
- Use relative paths for all assets
- Include a README with setup and export instructions
- Example directory structure:
  ```
  presentation/
  ├── presentation.md
  ├── README.md
  ├── images/
  │   ├── logo.png
  │   └── diagram.svg
  └── themes/
      └── custom-theme.css
  ```

### Version Control
- Commit both source markdown and exported PDFs
- Use meaningful commit messages describing content changes
- Consider tagging major versions of presentations

### Speaker Notes
- Use HTML comments for speaker notes
- Place notes immediately after the content they refer to
- Example:
  ```markdown
  # Important Slide
  
  Key points about the topic
  
  <!-- 
  Speaker notes:
  - Mention the research from Smith (2023)
  - Ask audience about their experience
  -->
  ```

### Presentation Mode
- Test presentation in the target environment before presenting
- Use presenter mode when available
- Set up keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Consider browser presentation settings:
  ```markdown
  ---
  marp: true
  presenter: true
  ---
  ```

## Benefits
- Consistent and reliable presentation delivery
- Better organization of presentation assets
- Improved collaboration on presentation content
- Professional delivery with speaker notes and proper formatting
