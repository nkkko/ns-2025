  # Documentation in Jupyter Notebooks

  ## Notebook Structure
  - Begin with a title and overview markdown cell
  - Include author information, date, and version
  - Add a table of contents for longer notebooks
  - Organize content with clear section headers (using markdown headings)
  - End with a conclusion or summary section

  ## Markdown Usage
  - Use markdown cells to explain the purpose of code cells that follow
  - Document the "why" behind code decisions, not just the "what"
  - Include explanations of complex algorithms or techniques
  - Use markdown formatting (bold, italic, lists) for better readability
  - Add horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections

  ## Code Documentation
  - Include docstrings for all functions and classes
  - Add inline comments for complex or non-obvious code
  - Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
  - Explain the purpose of visualization cells and what to look for
  - Document data transformations and the rationale behind them

  ## References
  - Include citations for papers, methods, or external resources
  - Add links to relevant documentation or tutorials
  - Reference data sources with proper attribution
  - Document any assumptions made in the analysis
  - Include links to related notebooks or projects
