# Rule: Marp Content Best Practices

## Description
This rule provides guidelines for creating effective content in Marp presentations, focusing on readability, accessibility, and audience engagement.

## Implementation Details

### Text Content
- Follow the 6x6 rule: maximum 6 bullet points per slide, maximum 6 words per bullet
- Use sentence case for slide titles and headers
- Maintain consistent font sizes throughout the presentation
- Avoid walls of text; break complex ideas into multiple slides

### Code Blocks
- Use syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Keep code examples short and focused
- Consider using line highlighting for important parts
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ```python
  # This is a Python code block
  def hello_world():
      print("Hello, Marp!")
  ```
  ```

### Tables
- Keep tables simple with minimal columns
- Use Markdown table syntax for better readability
- Example:
  ```markdown
  | Header 1 | Header 2 |
  | -------- | -------- |
  | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
  | Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
  ```

### Diagrams
- Use Mermaid.js for diagrams when supported
- Keep diagrams simple and focused on one concept
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ```mermaid
  graph LR
      A[Start] --> B[Process]
      B --> C[End]
  ```
  ```

### Accessibility
- Use sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Include alt text for images
- Example:
  ```markdown
  ![alt: Description of the image](mdc:path/to/image.png)
  ```

### Citations and References
- Include citations for data, quotes, and external content
- Add a references slide at the end of the presentation
- Use consistent citation format

## Benefits
- Improved audience comprehension and retention
- More accessible presentations for all viewers
- Professional appearance and credibility
- Better engagement through focused content
