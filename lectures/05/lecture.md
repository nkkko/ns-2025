## What We'll Learn Today

- What are communities in networks and why they matter
- Step-by-step approaches to detect communities
- Simple community detection algorithms with examples
- How to evaluate community detection results
- Real-world applications of community detection

---

## What is a Community?

A **community** in a network is a group of nodes that are:
- More densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network
- Often share common properties or functions
- May overlap or be arranged hierarchically

**Real-world examples:**
- Friend groups in social networks
- Research topics in citation networks
- Functional modules in protein networks

---

## Visualizing Communities in Networks

![bg right:50% width:630px](images/social_network_communities.png)

In this network:
- Each color represents a different community
- Nodes in the same community are more connected to each other
- Few connections exist between different communities

---

## Why Detect Communities?

Communities help us understand network structure and function:

- **Simplify complex networks** by identifying natural groupings
- **Discover hidden relationships** between nodes
- **Predict missing connections** within communities
- **Identify key nodes** that bridge communities

Communities reveal the underlying organization of a network!

---

## Step 1: Measuring Community Quality

Before detecting communities, we need a way to measure their quality!

**Modularity** is the most common quality metric:
- Measures how well a network is divided into communities
- Compares actual connections within communities to random expectations
- Values range from -0.5 to 1.0 (higher values = better communities)

---

## Understanding Modularity: Simple Explanation

Modularity answers: "Is the community structure better than random?"

- **Q > 0**: More connections within communities than expected by chance (good)
- **Q = 0**: Community structure no better than random (neutral)
- **Q < 0**: Fewer connections within communities than expected (poor)

The higher the modularity, the more definite the community structure.

---

## NetworkX Example: Calculating Modularity

![bg right:50% width:730px](images/modularity_example.png)

The barbell graph shows two clear communities with a high modularity value. The different colors represent the communities detected by the Louvain algorithm.

---

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple network with two clear communities
G = nx.barbell_graph(5, 0)  # Two complete graphs connected by a single edge

# Use the Louvain method to detect communities
communities = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Calculate the modularity of this partition
modularity = community_louvain.modularity(communities, G)
print(f"Modularity: {modularity:.4f}")

# Visualize the communities
colors = [communities[node] for node in G.nodes()]
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
nx.draw(G, pos, node_color=colors, cmap=plt.cm.Set1,
        with_labels=True, node_size=500)
plt.title(f"Network with Two Communities (Modularity: {modularity:.4f})")
plt.show()
```

---

## Let's Start Simple: Hierarchical Clustering

**Hierarchical clustering** builds communities from the bottom up:

1. Start with each node in its own community
2. Repeatedly merge the closest communities
3. Continue until all nodes are in a single community
4. Create a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchy

This approach works well for small to medium-sized networks.

---

## Hierarchical Clustering: Visual Step by Step

![width:900px](images/hierarchical_clustering.png)

---

The process shown from left to right:
1. **Initial**: Each node in its own community
2. **Early Stage**: Most similar nodes merge
3. **Middle Stage**: Small communities form
4. **Final Stage**: All nodes in one community
5. **Dendrogram**: Shows the merge history

---

## NetworkX Example: Hierarchical Clustering

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
from scipy.spatial.distance import squareform

# Create a sample network
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Create a distance matrix based on shortest paths
path_length = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))
distances = np.zeros((len(G), len(G)))
for i, u in enumerate(G.nodes()):
    for j, v in enumerate(G.nodes()):
        distances[i, j] = path_length[u][v]
```
---
```python
# Convert distances to a condensed form for linkage
condensed_dist = squareform(distances)

# Perform hierarchical clustering
Z = linkage(condensed_dist, method='ward')

# Plot the dendrogram
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
dendrogram(Z, labels=list(G.nodes()), leaf_rotation=90)
plt.title('Hierarchical Clustering of Karate Club Network')
plt.xlabel('Node ID')
plt.ylabel('Distance')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Get cluster assignments at a specific level (e.g., 2 clusters)
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import fcluster
clusters = fcluster(Z, 2, criterion='maxclust')

# Visualize the communities
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_color=clusters, cmap=plt.cm.Set1, node_size=100)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Karate Club Network Communities')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

## The Louvain Method: Fast and Effective

The **Louvain method** is one of the most popular approaches:

1. **Phase 1 (Local Optimization)**:
   - Start with each node in its own community
   - Move nodes to neighboring communities if modularity improves
   - Repeat until no improvement is possible

2. **Phase 2 (Community Aggregation)**:
   - Create a new network where nodes = communities from Phase 1
   - Repeat Phase 1 on this new network
   - Continue until maximum modularity is reached

---

## Louvain Method: Step by Step Visualization

![width:950px](images/louvain_method.png)

The Louvain method works in phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Optimize each node's community placement
2. **Phase 2**: Collapse communities into supernodes
3. **Final**: Repeat until optimal modularity is achieved

<!-- Left Panel (Phase 1: Local Optimization)

  This first phase shows the initial community detection:
  - Each node starts in its own community and then moves to neighboring communities that maximize modularity gain
  - You can see that nodes with similar colors have been grouped together
  - This is a greedy local optimization where each node finds its best community

  Middle Panel (Phase 2: Community Aggregation)

  This shows what happens after the first phase completes:
  - The communities found in Phase 1 are collapsed into "super-nodes"
  - Each super-node represents an entire community (the colored clusters from Phase 1)
  - The edges between super-nodes represent the connections between communities
  - This compression preserves the network's community structure while simplifying it

  Right Panel (Final Result)

  This shows the final outcome after iteratively applying both phases:
  - The algorithm repeats Phases 1 and 2 until no further improvement in modularity is possible
  - Each color represents a distinct community in the network
  - These communities maximize internal connections while minimizing external ones
  - The final partition has a high modularity value, indicating good community structure

  The strength of the Louvain method is this multi-level approach - by collapsing communities and repeating the process, it can efficiently find
  community structure at different scales, making it effective for both small and large networks.-->

---

## NetworkX Example: Louvain Method

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm

# Create a network (using the Karate Club as an example)
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Apply the Louvain method
communities = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Count the number of communities
num_communities = len(set(communities.values()))
print(f"Number of communities detected: {num_communities}")

# Calculate the modularity
modularity = community_louvain.modularity(communities, G)
print(f"Modularity: {modularity:.4f}")
```

---

```python
# Visualize the communities
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Color nodes based on community
cmap = cm.get_cmap('viridis', max(communities.values()) + 1)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, communities.keys(),
                       node_size=250,
                       cmap=cmap,
                       node_color=list(communities.values()))
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10)

plt.title(f"Communities in Karate Club Network\nModularity: {modularity:.4f}")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This example applies the Louvain method to the Zachary's Karate Club network and visualizes the detected communities.

---

## Label Propagation: A Simple, Fast Approach

**Label Propagation** is intuitive and easy to understand:

1. Assign each node a unique label (community ID)
2. Iteratively update each node's label to the most common label among its neighbors
3. Break ties randomly
4. Stop when labels stabilize (or after a fixed number of iterations)

Advantages:
- Near-linear time complexity (very fast)
- Easy to implement and understand
- Works well for large networks

---

## Label Propagation: Visual Example

![width:900px](images/label_propagation_example.png)

The label propagation process happens in stages:

1. **Initial State:** Each node starts with a unique label (color)
2. **Propagation Steps:** Nodes adopt the most frequent label from their neighbors
3. **Final State:** Nodes in densely connected groups converge to the same label

---

## NetworkX Example: Label Propagation

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a network with community structure
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Apply label propagation
communities = nx.algorithms.community.label_propagation_communities(G)

# Convert communities to a dictionary for visualization
community_map = {}
for i, community in enumerate(communities):
    for node in community:
        community_map[node] = i
```
---
```python
# Visualize the communities
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Color nodes based on community
colors = [community_map[node] for node in G.nodes()]
nx.draw(G, pos, node_color=colors, cmap=plt.cm.rainbow,
        with_labels=True, node_size=500)

plt.title("Communities Detected by Label Propagation")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

# Print statistics
print(f"Number of communities detected: {len(set(community_map.values()))}")
# You can't directly calculate modularity with NetworkX's implementation
# but you could convert the communities to the format required by community_louvain
```

Label propagation is simpler to understand than the Louvain method, making it a good introduction to community detection.

---

## Evaluating Community Detection Results

How do we know if our communities are good?

**Internal evaluation** (without ground truth):
- **Modularity**: Higher values indicate better separation
- **Conductance**: Ratio of external to internal edges (lower is better)
- **Coverage**: Fraction of edges within communities (higher is better)

**External evaluation** (with known communities):
- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)**: Measures information shared between detected and true communities
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: Measures similarity between community assignments

---

## NetworkX Example: Evaluating Communities

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
from sklearn.metrics import normalized_mutual_information_score, adjusted_rand_score

# Create a network with known communities (barbell graph)
G = nx.barbell_graph(5, 0)

# Define ground truth communities
true_communities = {}
for i in range(10):
    if i < 5:
        true_communities[i] = 0  # First community
    else:
        true_communities[i] = 1  # Second community

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
detected = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
```
---
```python
# Calculate modularity
modularity = community_louvain.modularity(detected, G)
print(f"Modularity: {modularity:.4f}")

# Convert to lists for sklearn metrics
true_labels = [true_communities[i] for i in sorted(G.nodes())]
detected_labels = [detected[i] for i in sorted(G.nodes())]

# Calculate external metrics
nmi = normalized_mutual_information_score(true_labels, detected_labels)
ari = adjusted_rand_score(true_labels, detected_labels)

print(f"Normalized Mutual Information: {nmi:.4f}")
print(f"Adjusted Rand Index: {ari:.4f}")
```

This example shows how to evaluate community detection results both with and without ground truth.

## Overlapping Communities: When Nodes Belong to Multiple Groups

In real networks, nodes often belong to multiple communities:
- A person can be part of multiple social circles
- A protein can participate in several biological functions
- A document can cover multiple topics

**Clique Percolation Method (CPM)** is popular for finding overlapping communities:
1. Find all k-cliques (fully connected subgraphs of k nodes)
2. Connect cliques that share k-1 nodes
3. Each connected component of cliques forms a community

---

## Clique Percolation Method: Step by Step

![width:700px](images/cpm_example.png)

The process of finding overlapping communities:
1. **Original Network**: The network we want to analyze
2. **Find k-cliques**: Identify all triangles (3-cliques)
3. **Build Clique Graph**: Connect cliques that share k-1 nodes
4. **Identify Communities**: Map connected components back to original network

---

## NetworkX Example: Clique Percolation Method

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from networkx.algorithms.community import k_clique_communities

# Create a simple network with overlapping communities
G = nx.Graph()
# First community
G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
# Second community
G.add_edges_from([(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)])

# Find overlapping communities using k-clique percolation (k=3)
communities = list(k_clique_communities(G, 3))

# Print communities
print("Overlapping communities:")
for i, community in enumerate(communities):
    print(f"Community {i+1}: {community}")

# Find overlapping nodes
all_nodes = set()
for community in communities:
    all_nodes.update(community)

overlapping = set()
for node in all_nodes:
    count = sum(1 for community in communities if node in community)
    if count > 1:
        overlapping.add(node)

print(f"Overlapping nodes: {overlapping}")

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Draw regular nodes
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, nodelist=list(all_nodes - overlapping),
                      node_color='lightblue', node_size=500)
# Draw overlapping nodes
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, nodelist=list(overlapping),
                      node_color='yellow', node_size=500)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)

plt.title("Overlapping Communities")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This example implements the Clique Percolation Method to find overlapping communities.

## Case Study: Zachary's Karate Club

Let's revisit the famous Karate Club network:

![bg right:50% width:630px](images/karate_club_communities.png)

- Network represents friendships in a karate club that split into two groups
- Community detection can recover this split without prior knowledge
- Different algorithms find slightly different community structures

---

## Complete Example: Community Detection on Karate Club

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm
import numpy as np

# Create the karate club graph
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Get the actual split that happened (ground truth)
# Node 0 is Mr. Hi (instructor) and node 33 is John A (administrator)
true_communities = {}
for node in G.nodes():
    # Club actually split into two factions
    if node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21]:
        true_communities[node] = 0  # Mr. Hi's group
    else:
        true_communities[node] = 1  # John A's group

# Apply the Louvain method for community detection
detected_communities = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Calculate modularity
modularity = community_louvain.modularity(detected_communities, G)
print(f"Modularity of detected communities: {modularity:.4f}")

# Compare detected with true communities
matches = sum(1 for node in G.nodes()
              if true_communities[node] == detected_communities[node])
accuracy = matches / len(G.nodes())
print(f"Accuracy compared to true split: {accuracy:.2%}")

# Visualize both true and detected communities
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 7))

# Use the same layout for both visualizations
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Draw true communities
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, ax=ax1,
                     node_color=[true_communities[n] for n in G.nodes()],
                     cmap=cm.get_cmap('Set1', 2),
                     node_size=300)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, ax=ax1, alpha=0.5)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, ax=ax1, font_size=10)
ax1.set_title("True Communities")
ax1.axis('off')

# Draw detected communities
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, ax=ax2,
                     node_color=[detected_communities[n] for n in G.nodes()],
                     cmap=cm.get_cmap('Set1', max(detected_communities.values()) + 1),
                     node_size=300)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, ax=ax2, alpha=0.5)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, ax=ax2, font_size=10)
ax2.set_title(f"Detected Communities (Modularity: {modularity:.2f})")
ax2.axis('off')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This comprehensive example compares the community detection results to the actual split that happened in the karate club.

## Practical Application Example: Discovering Topics

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.cm as cm

# Create a citation network (simplistic example)
G = nx.Graph()

# Add papers as nodes with topics as attributes
papers = {
    'paper1': {'topic': 'ML'},
    'paper2': {'topic': 'ML'},
    'paper3': {'topic': 'ML'},
    'paper4': {'topic': 'Networks'},
    'paper5': {'topic': 'Networks'},
    'paper6': {'topic': 'Networks'},
    'paper7': {'topic': 'Mixed'},  # Bridge paper
    'paper8': {'topic': 'Chemistry'},
    'paper9': {'topic': 'Chemistry'},
    'paper10': {'topic': 'Chemistry'}
}

G.add_nodes_from(papers.keys())
nx.set_node_attributes(G, papers)

# Add citation links (mostly within topics)
citations = [
    ('paper1', 'paper2'), ('paper2', 'paper3'), ('paper1', 'paper3'),
    ('paper4', 'paper5'), ('paper5', 'paper6'), ('paper4', 'paper6'),
    ('paper8', 'paper9'), ('paper9', 'paper10'), ('paper8', 'paper10'),
    # Bridge papers
    ('paper3', 'paper7'), ('paper6', 'paper7'), ('paper7', 'paper8')
]
G.add_edges_from(citations)

# Detect communities
communities = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Check if detected communities match actual topics
topic_to_community = {}
for paper, comm_id in communities.items():
    topic = G.nodes[paper]['topic']
    if topic not in topic_to_community:
        topic_to_community[topic] = []
    topic_to_community[topic].append(comm_id)

print("Topics and their detected communities:")
for topic, comm_ids in topic_to_community.items():
    print(f"{topic}: {set(comm_ids)}")

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Color nodes by detected community
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, node_color=list(communities.values()),
                      cmap=cm.get_cmap('viridis', max(communities.values()) + 1),
                      node_size=500)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, alpha=0.5)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos)

plt.title("Citation Network with Detected Topic Communities")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This example demonstrates how community detection can be used to discover topics in a citation network.
