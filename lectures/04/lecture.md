## Overview

- Connected components in undirected graphs
- Strongly and weakly connected components in directed graphs
- Articulation points (cut vertices)
- Bridges (cut edges)
- Network resilience and vulnerability
- Practical applications

---

## Connected Components

A **connected component** is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths.

- In an undirected graph, a connected component is a maximal connected subgraph
- Every vertex belongs to exactly one connected component
- The largest connected component is often called the **Giant Connected Component (GCC)**

## Finding Connected Components in NetworkX

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph with multiple components
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7)])

# Find all connected components
components = list(nx.connected_components(G))
print(f"Number of components: {len(components)}")

# Get the largest connected component (GCC)
gcc = max(components, key=len)
print(f"Size of GCC: {len(gcc)}")

# Create a subgraph of the largest component
gcc_subgraph = G.subgraph(gcc)
```

---

## Directed Graph Connectivity

In directed graphs, connectivity is more complex:

- **Strongly Connected Component (SCC)**: A subgraph where there is a directed path from any vertex to any other vertex
- **Weakly Connected Component (WCC)**: A subgraph that would be connected if the directed edges were replaced with undirected edges

---

## Strongly Connected Components Example

---

## Finding Strongly Connected Components in NetworkX

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4)])

# Find strongly connected components
sccs = list(nx.strongly_connected_components(G))
print(f"Number of SCCs: {len(sccs)}")

# Find weakly connected components
wccs = list(nx.weakly_connected_components(G))
print(f"Number of WCCs: {len(wccs)}")
```

---

## Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)

An **articulation point** (or cut vertex) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components.

- Critical nodes that can disconnect the network
- Important for identifying network vulnerabilities
- Removing an articulation point breaks the graph into multiple components

---

## Articulation Points Example

---

## Finding Articulation Points in NetworkX

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)])

# Find articulation points
cut_vertices = list(nx.articulation_points(G))
print(f"Articulation points: {cut_vertices}")

# Check connectivity before and after removing a cut vertex
print(f"Connected components before: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
G.remove_node(cut_vertices[0])
print(f"Connected components after: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
```

---

## Bridges (Cut Edges)

A **bridge** (or cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components.

- Critical connections that can disconnect the network
- Important for identifying network vulnerabilities
- Similar to articulation points but for edges

---

## Bridges Example

---

## Finding Bridges in NetworkX

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)])

# Find bridges
bridges = list(nx.bridges(G))
print(f"Bridges: {bridges}")

# Check connectivity before and after removing a bridge
print(f"Connected components before: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
G.remove_edge(*bridges[0])
print(f"Connected components after: {nx.number_connected_components(G)}")
```

## Network Resilience

Network resilience refers to a network's ability to maintain its connectivity when nodes or edges are removed.

- **Random failures**: Random removal of nodes or edges
- **Targeted attacks**: Removal of high-degree nodes or critical nodes
- **Cascading failures**: Failures that trigger additional failures

## Analyzing Network Resilience in NetworkX

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a scale-free network
G = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(100, 2, seed=42)

# Measure connectivity as nodes are removed
results = []
for i in range(30):
    # Remove highest degree node
    if len(G.nodes()) > 0:
        node_to_remove = max(G.degree, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
        G.remove_node(node_to_remove)

        # Measure size of largest component
        if len(G.nodes()) > 0:
            gcc_size = len(max(nx.connected_components(G), key=len))
            results.append(gcc_size / len(G.nodes()))
```

## Applications of Network Connectivity Analysis

- **Infrastructure networks**: Identifying critical points in power grids, transportation networks
- **Communication networks**: Ensuring robustness of internet and telecommunication systems
- **Biological networks**: Understanding resilience in protein interaction networks
- **Social networks**: Identifying key individuals who connect different communities

## Coding Task: Analyzing Transportation Network

Analyze the connectivity of a transportation network after removing critical nodes:

1. Create a graph representing a transportation network
2. Identify articulation points and bridges
3. Analyze how removing these critical elements affects connectivity
4. Visualize the network before and after removal
5. Suggest strategies to improve network resilience

---

## Natural Language Task

Explain the importance of identifying articulation points in a network:

- Why are articulation points critical for network analysis?
- How do articulation points relate to network vulnerability?
- What real-world examples demonstrate the importance of articulation points?
- How can we strengthen networks with critical articulation points?

---

## Summary

- Connected components help us understand the structure of networks
- Strongly and weakly connected components apply to directed graphs
- Articulation points and bridges are critical for network vulnerability analysis
- Network resilience measures a network's ability to maintain connectivity
- Connectivity analysis has applications across many domains
